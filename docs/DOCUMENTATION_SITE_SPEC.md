# Markdown Studio Documentation Website — AI Implementation Specification

## 1. Mission

Build a professional public documentation and product website for **Markdown Studio**, the cross-platform desktop Markdown editor in this repository.

Repository:
`https://github.com/nasimuddinbd02/markdown-studio`

The website must support GitHub Pages hosting, Google search indexing, product discovery, downloads, user documentation, troubleshooting, releases, and future pricing/monetization pages.

## 2. Critical Instructions for the AI Agent

Before making changes:

1. Inspect the complete repository structure.
2. Inspect `README.md`, existing `docs/`, SRS, traceability documents, `package.json`, `src/`, `src-tauri/`, GitHub Actions, release configuration, screenshots/assets, current version, supported OSes, and installer formats.
3. Determine which features are actually implemented.
4. Reuse existing documentation and branding where appropriate.
5. Do not document or advertise features that are not implemented.
6. Do not invent versions, download links, pricing, user counts, reviews, ratings, awards, certifications, compatibility claims, or performance claims.

The source code and current release artifacts are the source of truth.

## 3. Goals

The website must allow visitors to:

- Understand Markdown Studio.
- Discover supported features.
- Download the application.
- Install it on supported platforms.
- Learn how to use it.
- Find answers to common questions.
- Troubleshoot problems.
- Read releases/changelog.
- View the roadmap.
- Visit the GitHub repository.
- Discover documentation through Google and other search engines.

Desired flow:

```text
Google Search
  -> Markdown Studio Website
  -> Product Overview
  -> Features
  -> Download
  -> Documentation
  -> FAQ / Troubleshooting
  -> GitHub
```

## 4. Technology

Use a static documentation/site framework.

Preferred: **VitePress**

Acceptable alternatives: Docusaurus or Astro Starlight.

Requirements:

- Static site generation.
- GitHub Pages compatible.
- Markdown content.
- Documentation navigation.
- Dark/light mode.
- Responsive design.
- SEO metadata.
- Sitemap.
- Syntax-highlighted code.
- No server-side backend.

## 5. Repository Structure

Prefer keeping the site inside the existing repository:

```text
markdown-studio/
├── src/
├── src-tauri/
├── tests/
├── docs/
│   └── DOCUMENTATION_SITE_SPEC.md
├── website/
│   ├── .vitepress/
│   │   ├── config.ts
│   │   └── theme/
│   ├── docs/
│   │   ├── index.md
│   │   ├── download.md
│   │   ├── features.md
│   │   ├── faq.md
│   │   ├── changelog.md
│   │   ├── roadmap.md
│   │   ├── installation/
│   │   ├── getting-started/
│   │   ├── guide/
│   │   ├── reference/
│   │   └── troubleshooting/

│   │   └── images/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── README.md
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── documentation.yml
```

If an existing documentation infrastructure is present, improve it rather than creating a duplicate.

6. Review SEO issues.

Never put credentials in the repository.

## 32. GitHub Pages Deployment

Create:

`.github/workflows/documentation.yml`

The workflow must:

1. Trigger when documentation website files change.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Build the static website.
4. Validate links/content where practical.
5. Upload the Pages artifact.
6. Deploy to GitHub Pages.

The workflow must fail if the site build fails.

## 33. Pull Request Validation

Provide appropriate scripts, such as:

```text
npm run docs:dev
npm run docs:build
npm run docs:preview
npm run docs:check
```

Use names appropriate to the selected framework.

Validation should detect, where practical:

- Broken internal links.
- Invalid Markdown.
- Missing metadata.
- Configuration errors.

## 34. Responsive Design

Support:

- Desktop.
- Laptop.
- Tablet.
- Mobile.

Requirements:

- Mobile navigation.
- Responsive sidebar.
- Responsive tables.
- Horizontal scrolling for long code blocks.
- Responsive screenshots.
- Touch-friendly controls.

## 35. Visual Design

The site should feel:

- Modern.
- Professional.
- Developer-focused.
- Clean.
- Technical.
- Fast.
- Minimal.

Use:

- Consistent spacing.
- Professional typography.
- Code-friendly fonts.
- Clear hierarchy.
- Subtle borders.
- Accessible colors.
- Consistent icons.

Avoid excessive animations.

## 36. Dark Mode

Support:

```text
Light
Dark
System
```

if supported by the framework.

Ensure code blocks, links, screenshots, and navigation remain readable.

## 37. Accessibility

Use semantic HTML.

Support:

- Keyboard navigation.
- Visible focus.
- Accessible buttons.
- Accessible navigation.
- Meaningful alt text.
- Sufficient color contrast.
- Screen-reader-friendly structure.
- No important information conveyed only by color.

## 38. Performance

Use static generation and minimize JavaScript.

Optimize:

- Images.
- JavaScript.
- CSS.
- Fonts.
- Client-side dependencies.

Target:

```text
Performance >= 90
Accessibility >= 90
Best Practices >= 90
SEO >= 90
```

These are targets, not guarantees.

## 39. Images

Use actual application screenshots where available.

Recommended:

```text
website/public/images/
├── markdown-studio-home.webp
├── markdown-studio-editor.webp
├── markdown-studio-preview.webp
├── markdown-studio-file-explorer.webp
└── markdown-studio-mermaid.webp
```

Use optimized image formats and descriptive alt text.

Do not create fake screenshots.

## 40. Privacy

Document actual privacy behavior.

If editing is local-first, explain what stays local.

If AI functionality sends content externally, document:

- What is sent.
- When it is sent.
- Which provider receives it.
- How the feature can be disabled.

Do not make unsupported privacy claims.

## 41. Security

The website must:

- Never expose GitHub tokens.
- Never expose API keys.
- Never expose signing certificates.
- Never commit `.env` secrets.
- Avoid unsafe HTML rendering.
- Sanitize dynamic content.
- Validate external links where appropriate.

## 42. GitHub Links

Use the actual repository:

`https://github.com/nasimuddinbd02/markdown-studio`

Provide links to:

- Repository.
- Issues.
- Discussions if enabled.
- Releases.
- Contributing.
- License.

## 43. Version Management

Avoid duplicating the application version manually.

Where practical:

```text
Application Version
  -> Website
  -> Download Page
  -> Changelog
  -> Release Information
```

Use package/release metadata as the source of truth.

## 44. Future Monetization

Design the website so future pages can be added:

```text
/pricing
/pro
/ai
/cloud
/teams
/enterprise
```

Do not implement payments unless explicitly requested.

## 45. AI Coding Agent Workflow

### Phase 1 — Repository Analysis

Before coding:

1. Inspect repository.
2. Inspect current documentation.
3. Inspect application source.
4. Identify implemented features.
5. Identify screenshots/assets.
6. Identify current version.
7. Identify release artifacts.
8. Identify current GitHub Actions.
9. Identify existing documentation infrastructure.

Create an internal feature inventory:

```text
Feature | Implemented? | Documentation exists? | Screenshot exists? | Release support?
```

### Phase 2 — Architecture

Select the documentation framework.

Document:

- Why it was selected.
- Where files will live.
- How it builds.
- How GitHub Pages deploys.

Avoid unnecessary dependencies.

### Phase 3 — Implementation

Implement:

1. Homepage.
2. Download page.
3. Features.
4. Getting Started.
5. Installation.
6. User Guide.
7. Markdown reference.
8. FAQ.
9. Troubleshooting.
10. Changelog.
11. Roadmap.
12. GitHub integration.
13. SEO.
14. Sitemap.
15. robots.txt.
16. GitHub Pages workflow.

### Phase 4 — Validation

Run:

```text
Build
Link validation
Markdown validation
Type checking
Linting
Tests
```

Fix errors before completion.

### Phase 5 — Deployment

Configure GitHub Pages and verify:

- Homepage.
- Download.
- Documentation.
- Navigation.
- Images.
- GitHub links.
- Release links.
- Sitemap.
- robots.txt.

## 46. Do Not Break the Desktop Application

The documentation website must not:

- Break the desktop build.
- Change application behavior unnecessarily.
- Replace application dependencies.
- Change Tauri configuration without justification.
- Change release configuration without justification.
- Remove existing tests.
- Remove working features.
- Delete useful existing documentation.

Keep website dependencies isolated where practical.

## 48. Final Agent Report

At the end, report:

```text
1. Documentation framework selected
2. Files created
3. Files modified
4. Documentation pages created
5. Features documented
6. SEO implementation

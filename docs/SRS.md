- File explorer/navigation panel on the left.
- Editor area in the center.
- Markdown preview on the right when split view is enabled.
- Document tabs above the editor.
- Status bar showing encoding, language, line/column, and save state.
- Settings/preferences screen.
- Native dialogs for opening and saving files.

### 8.1 Main Screen

Conceptual layout: File Explorer | Tabs + Editor | Preview. The layout shall be resizable, and panels should remember their last user-selected dimensions where practical.

## 9. Technical Architecture

Recommended architecture:

| Layer | Technology / Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Desktop Shell | Tauri 2; native window, lifecycle, permissions, packaging. |
| UI | React + TypeScript; components, layouts, settings. |
| Editor | CodeMirror 6 or equivalent modern editor component. |
| Markdown | remark/Unified ecosystem and GitHub Flavored Markdown support. |
| Rendering | react-markdown or equivalent controlled renderer; sanitization required. |
| State | Zustand or equivalent lightweight state management. |
| Native APIs | Tauri filesystem, dialog, path, window, and updater capabilities. |
| Build | Vite + Tauri build pipeline. |
| Distribution | GitHub Releases or equivalent artifact hosting plus platform signing/notarization. |

### 9.1 Architectural Principles

- Local-first for core editing.
- Least-privilege filesystem permissions.
- Clear separation between UI state and native filesystem operations.
- No requirement for a backend server in MVP.
- Provider-agnostic design for future AI integration.
- Testable services for file operations and Markdown rendering.

## 10. Data and File Handling

### 10.1 Supported Files

- Primary extensions: .md and .markdown.
- Encoding: UTF-8.
- Line endings: LF and CRLF should be read correctly; save behavior should be configurable or consistent by documented policy.
- Optional future support: .mdx and front-matter-aware documents.

### 10.2 Save Strategy

- The application shall write the current editor content to the selected file.
- Save failures shall not clear the editor's dirty state.
- The application should use an atomic or temporary-file strategy where practical to reduce corruption risk.
- The application shall detect permission failures and present an actionable message.
- Before overwriting a file changed externally, the application should notify the user and provide a safe choice.

## 11. Security Requirements

- **SEC-001:** The application shall use Tauri's permission/capability model and grant only required native permissions.
- **SEC-002:** User-supplied paths shall be validated before filesystem operations.
- **SEC-003:** Path traversal such as ../ shall not permit unintended access outside an approved operation scope.
- **SEC-004:** Preview rendering shall not execute arbitrary untrusted scripts.
- **SEC-005:** External links shall open through controlled OS/browser mechanisms rather than arbitrary embedded execution.
- **SEC-006:** Any future AI integration shall clearly identify when document content leaves the local machine.
- **SEC-007:** Secrets/API keys shall not be hard-coded into the client application.
- **SEC-008:** Release artifacts should be digitally signed where supported by the target platform.

## 12. Error Handling and Recovery

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|---|---|
| File not found | Show a clear error and offer to locate/reopen the file. |
| Permission denied | Explain that the file cannot be written and provide Save As as an alternative. |
| Invalid/unsupported encoding | Report the issue without silently corrupting content. |
| External file modification | Notify user and provide reload/compare/keep-current options as supported. |
| Application crash | Attempt to recover unsaved content through a recovery mechanism where feasible. |
| Insufficient disk space | Report failure and keep the editor content available for another save attempt. |
| Corrupt configuration | Use safe defaults and preserve recoverable user data. |

## 13. Packaging, Installation, and Distribution

### 13.1 Windows

- Provide signed .msi and/or .exe installer.
- Support x64 initially; add ARM64 if required by the product roadmap.
- Create Start Menu and optional desktop shortcuts.
- Support clean uninstall through standard Windows mechanisms.

### 13.2 macOS

- Provide signed .dmg and/or application bundle.
- Support Intel and Apple Silicon according to the release target.
- Use Apple notarization for public distribution.

Minimum versions are documented in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). Code signing (Authenticode, Apple notarization) is still pending certificates, and Windows/Linux ARM64 are not built yet.

### 13.4 Distribution Website

The product website shall provide OS-specific download options. The site may detect the user's operating system and recommend the appropriate installer. Release binaries may be hosted through GitHub Releases, cloud object storage, or another controlled distribution service.

## 14. Auto-Update Requirements

- **UPD-001:** The application should support optional automatic update checks.
- **UPD-002:** The user shall be able to see the current version and available version.
- **UPD-003:** Updates shall be cryptographically verified before installation.
- **UPD-004:** The user shall be able to postpone an update.
- **UPD-005:** Failed updates shall not leave the application in an unusable state.
- **UPD-006:** Update behavior shall respect platform-specific signing and security requirements.

## 15. Accessibility and Usability

- Core functions shall be accessible by keyboard.
- Menus and buttons shall have clear labels/tooltips.
- Focus states shall be visible.
- Text and controls shall remain usable at increased UI scaling.
- Color shall not be the only indicator of document state.
- Error messages shall explain what happened and what the user can do next.
- The product shall follow practical WCAG-informed accessibility principles for its web-based UI components.

## 16. Logging and Diagnostics

- Application logs shall avoid storing document contents by default.
- Logs shall contain useful diagnostic information such as application version, operation type, and error category.
- Sensitive paths or secrets should be redacted where practical.
- The user should have a way to export diagnostic logs for support.
- Logging verbosity should be configurable for development/debug builds.

## 17. Testing and Acceptance Criteria

### 17.1 Test Levels

- Unit tests for file/path services, Markdown transformations, and state logic.
- Component tests for editor/preview interactions.
- Integration tests for Tauri filesystem operations.
- End-to-end tests for critical workflows.
- Manual acceptance testing on each supported operating system.

### 17.2 MVP Acceptance Criteria

- User can install the application on Windows, macOS, and Linux using documented installers/packages.
- User can create a Markdown file, enter content, preview it, save it, close it, and reopen it.
- User can open a folder and navigate Markdown files.
- Unsaved changes are clearly indicated and protected when closing a document.
- Markdown tables, lists, task lists, headings, links, images, and fenced code blocks render correctly.
- Application works for core editing without internet connectivity.
- Invalid paths and permission errors do not crash the application.
- Release artifacts are versioned and reproducibly built.
- Critical security tests for path traversal and unsafe preview content pass.

## 18. Release Strategy

| Release | Scope |
|---|---|
| v0.1 / MVP | Core editor, file operations, preview, tabs, themes, packaging. |
| v0.2 | Improved search/replace, recovery, external-change detection, recent files. |
| v0.3 | Mermaid, math, enhanced Markdown features, improved customization. |
| v1.0 | Stable cross-platform release, signing/notarization, updater, polished UX, documented support matrix. |

- AI writing and editing assistant.
- Local LLM integration through configurable providers.
- Cloud AI providers with explicit user consent.
- Git integration and source-control status.
- Markdown linting.
- Document outline and navigation.
- Mermaid diagrams and LaTeX math.
- Export to HTML and PDF.
- Plugin/extension architecture.
- Cloud synchronization.
- Real-time collaboration.
- Version history and document snapshots.
- Publishing to static sites or documentation platforms.

## 20. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Cross-platform filesystem differences | Use Tauri APIs and automated OS-specific tests. |
| macOS security warnings | Use Apple Developer signing and notarization for public releases. |
| Windows security/reputation warnings | Sign installers and establish a consistent release identity. |
| Data loss during save | Use safe-save/atomic strategies, dirty state, recovery, and backups where appropriate. |
| Unsafe Markdown/HTML rendering | Sanitize output and restrict script execution. |
| Large document performance | Benchmark large files and use editor virtualization/incremental rendering. |
| Update failure | Verify packages, provide rollback/recovery strategy, and test update paths. |
| Feature creep | Maintain MVP scope and prioritize future features in separate releases. |

## 21. Open Questions

| Question | Status |
|---|---|
| Which minimum Windows, macOS, and Linux versions will be officially supported? | **Answered in practice:** Windows 10 1803+ and 11; macOS 10.15+; Linux x86_64 distributions from 2022 (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, Fedora 36+). See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). |
| Will the first release support x64 only or x64 + ARM64? | **Partly answered:** Windows and Linux x64; macOS both Intel and Apple Silicon. Windows/Linux ARM64 are open. |
| Should the product use a permissive open-source license, a proprietary license, or a dual-license model? | Open: needs a decision by the product owner. |
| Will AI functionality be part of v1.0 or a later release? | Open. |
| Should AI features support local models, cloud providers, or both? | Open. |
| Should Markdown HTML be fully supported, partially supported, or sanitized to a strict subset? | **Answered:** raw HTML is parsed, then sanitized to GitHub's allow-list (FR-034, SEC-004). |
| Should the application include Git integration in the first major release? | Open. |
| What product name, domain, logo, and application identifier will be used for signing and releases? | **Partly answered:** "Markdown Studio", identifier `com.markdownstudio.app`, releases on GitHub. Domain and signing identity are open. |
| Will telemetry be collected? If yes, what is collected and what consent mechanism is required? | **Answered:** no telemetry. The app's only own network request is the optional update check to GitHub, which can be turned off in Settings (web images referenced in a document load when previewed). |

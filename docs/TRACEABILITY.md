# Requirements Traceability

Status of each [SRS](SRS.md) requirement as of version 0.11.0. **Done** means implemented and tested (automated or manual). **Partial** means some of it is implemented and the gap is noted. **Planned** means it's scheduled for the release named in the SRS.

## Functional requirements

| ID | Status | Implementation / notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FR-001 | Done | Tauri 2 native shell ([src-tauri/src/lib.rs](../src-tauri/src/lib.rs)) |

## Non-functional and security requirements

| ID | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NFR-001/002 | Done | CodeMirror virtualised rendering; debounced preview; live preview pauses above 1 MB (render on demand). The preview pipeline, exporters and Mermaid are lazy-loaded. A benchmark for very large files is still to be added |
| NFR-003 | Done | Measured at startup and logged |
| NFR-004 | Done | Save failures keep the document dirty; errors are shown as toasts or dialogs |
| NFR-005 | Done | No network access is required |
| NFR-006 | Done | A separate installer for each OS on every release: Windows NSIS (standard and offline) built by `scripts/release-installer.mjs`; macOS `.dmg` (Apple Silicon, Intel) and Linux `.AppImage`/`.deb`/`.rpm` built by [release.yml](../.github/workflows/release.yml). Rust tests run on all three in CI |
| NFR-007 | Done | Scope enforced in Rust ([scope.rs](../src-tauri/src/scope.rs)) |
| NFR-008 | Done | No telemetry; content never leaves the machine |
| NFR-009 | Done | Modular services and stores; Vitest and Rust tests |
| NFR-010 | Done | Keyboard menus, tree, tabs and dialogs; focus rings; automated axe-core WCAG 2.1 AA audit (light and dark) in e2e |
| NFR-011 | Done | Documented in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md): Windows 10 1803+ and 11 (x64), macOS 10.15+ (Apple Silicon and Intel), Linux x86_64 distributions from 2022 (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, Fedora 36+). ARM64 Windows/Linux are not built yet |
| SEC-001 | Done | The capability grants only `core:default`, set-title, destroy and full-screen; no filesystem, dialog or shell permissions ([default.json](../src-tauri/capabilities/default.json)) |
| SEC-002/003 | Done | Absolute paths only, `..` rejected, canonicalised scope check |
| SEC-004 | Done | Sanitisation tests in [markdown.test.tsx](../tests/markdown.test.tsx) |
| SEC-005 | Done | `open_external` accepts only http, https and mailto |
| SEC-006/007 | N/A | No AI or secrets in the MVP |
| SEC-008 | Partial | Updates are minisign-signed and verified. Installers aren't code-signed yet: Windows needs an Authenticode certificate; macOS is ad-hoc signed until an Apple Developer ID is added as `APPLE_*` secrets (the workflow then signs and notarizes) |
| UPD-001, UPD-002, UPD-004 | Done | `features/updates.ts`: a check on every startup (optional; Settings → Startup) and Help → Check for Updates. Shows the current and available versions, with Update Now, Later and Skip This Version. Where no in-place update exists for the platform (macOS, Linux), it offers the release page instead. Tests: `tests/updates.test.ts` |
| UPD-003, UPD-005, UPD-006 | Done (Windows) | `src-tauri/src/updater.rs` uses `tauri-plugin-updater`. `latest.json` on the latest GitHub Release points to the NSIS installer. The installer's minisign signature is verified against the public key in `tauri.conf.json` before it runs. Unsaved documents are saved first. On any failure the running version is unchanged. Verified end to end on Windows: a tampered manifest is rejected, and a signed update installs in place and relaunches |

## Test coverage

| Level | Where | Count (0.11.0) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit and component | `tests/` (Vitest, Testing Library, jsdom) | 225 tests in 37 files |
| End-to-end and accessibility | `e2e/` (Playwright; axe-core WCAG 2.1 AA audits in light and dark themes) | 21 tests |
| Rust | `#[cfg(test)]` modules in `src-tauri/src/` | 27 tests |

## Known gaps and next improvements

- PDF and Word export leave out footnotes (Word keeps the note text as paragraphs) and show Mermaid diagrams and math as code or text; HTML export and Print → Save as PDF keep them. Documented on the website.
- Code-sign the Windows installer (Authenticode) so SmartScreen doesn't warn; updates are already signature-verified.
- macOS builds are ad-hoc signed, not notarized (needs an Apple Developer ID). In-place updates are Windows-only; macOS and Linux are offered the download page (signing their updates in CI needs the updater key as a repository secret).
- The macOS and Linux builds haven't been run on real hardware yet, only built in CI.
- ARM64 builds for Windows and Linux (SRS §13.1, §21).
- The startup bundle is 691 KB (232 KB gzipped); the preview pipeline, export and Mermaid are lazy-loaded. It could be trimmed further (a highlight.js language subset).
- A native OS menu bar on macOS (the in-app menu is used on all platforms today).
- Large-file benchmark (10 MB+) and incremental preview rendering.
- Playwright runs against the browser demo; a Tauri-driver e2e run against the native build is still to do.
- Localization (i18n): waiting on the choice of languages.

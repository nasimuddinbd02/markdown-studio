# Settings

Open settings with **Ctrl+,** (**Cmd+,** on macOS), the gear button at the top right, or **File → Settings…**. Changes apply immediately and are saved automatically. Where they're stored is described in [Configuration](/reference/configuration).

## Appearance

| Setting | Options | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Theme | Match system, Light, Dark | Match system |
| Editor font size | 10–28 px | 15 px |
| Editor font family | Any installed font, for example `JetBrains Mono` | The default monospace font |

The moon button at the top right switches between light and dark quickly. **Ctrl+=**, **Ctrl+-** and **Ctrl+0** increase, decrease and reset the editor font size.

## Editor

| Setting | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Tab size (2, 4 or 8 spaces) | 2 |
| Show line numbers | On |
| Wrap long lines | On |
| Convert pasted web/Word content to Markdown | On |
| Check spelling (uses the system dictionary) | On |
| Check Markdown for problems (broken links, headings, alt text) | On |

## Files

| Setting | Options | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auto save | Off, After a delay, When switching tabs or windows | Off |
| Auto save delay | 0.5, 1, 3, 10 or 30 seconds | 1 second |
| Line endings for new files | LF (Unix, macOS), CRLF (Windows), Match operating system | LF |
| Trim trailing whitespace on save | | Off |
| Keep the table of contents up to date on save | | On |
| Insert a final newline on save | | Off |

Existing files always keep their own line endings. Untitled documents are never auto-saved. See [Saving, history & recovery](/guide/saving-and-recovery).

## Preview

| Setting | Options | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Update delay after typing | Instant, 150 ms, 300 ms, 600 ms, 1 second | 150 ms |
| Render LaTeX math (`$…$` and `$$…$$`) | | On |
| Render Mermaid diagrams | | On |
| Sync editor and preview scrolling | | On |

## Startup

| Setting | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Reopen last folder and files | On |
| Check for updates when Markdown Studio starts | On |

The update check asks GitHub for the latest version number; nothing else is sent. See [Privacy](/privacy).

## Reset to defaults

**Reset to Defaults** at the bottom of the Settings dialog restores every setting above to its default. Your open folder and files are kept.

## Remembered automatically

Markdown Studio also remembers the window size and position, the view (editor, split or preview), whether the explorer and outline are shown, and panel sizes.

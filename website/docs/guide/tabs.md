# Tabs

Every open document gets a tab above the editor. The active tab is marked with an accent bar and a bold name.

## Unsaved changes

A dot on a tab marks unsaved changes, and the tab's accessible name says "(unsaved)". The status bar and the window title show it too. If you close a tab or quit with unsaved changes, Markdown Studio asks whether to **Save**, **Don't Save** or **Cancel**.

## Switching and arranging

| Action | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| Next tab | Ctrl+Tab |
| Previous tab | Ctrl+Shift+Tab |
| Close tab | Ctrl+W (Cmd+W on macOS) |
| Reopen closed tab | Ctrl+Shift+T (Cmd+Shift+T on macOS) |

- Drag a tab left or right to reorder it.
- When the tab list has focus, the arrow keys move between tabs.
- The **+** button after the last tab creates a new file.

## Reopen closed tabs

**File → Reopen Closed Tab** reopens the most recently closed file; use it again for the one before, up to 20 files. Files that are already open again, or have been deleted, are skipped. Untitled documents that were never saved aren't kept.

## Tab context menu

Right-click a tab for:

- **Close**, **Close Others**, **Close to the Right** and **Close Saved**
- **File History…** (see [Saving & recovery](/guide/saving-and-recovery#file-history))
- **Copy Path** and **Reveal in File Explorer** (**Reveal in Finder** on macOS)

## Undo history

Each tab keeps its own undo history and cursor position while it's open, so switching tabs doesn't lose them.

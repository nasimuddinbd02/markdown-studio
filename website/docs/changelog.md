## v0.9.0

The first release delivered through the in-app updater.

## v0.8.0

Released: 2026-09-25 · [Release files](https://github.com/nasimuddinbd02/markdown-studio/releases/tag/v0.8.0)

### Added

- **Automatic updates on Windows.** At startup, Markdown Studio offers new versions with **Update Now**, **Later** or **Skip This Version**. It saves open documents, downloads the update, installs it in place and restarts. The startup check can be turned off in Settings.

### Security

- Updates are signed, and the signature is verified against a public key built into the app before anything is installed. A tampered or unsigned update is refused, and the current version keeps running.

## v0.7.0

Released: 2026-09-25 · [Release files](https://github.com/nasimuddinbd02/markdown-studio/releases/tag/v0.7.0)

### Added

- **Combine Folder into One Document**: merges every Markdown file in a folder into one document with a table of contents, turning links between files into in-document links and adjusting image paths.

## v0.6.0

Released: 2026-09-24 · [Release files](https://github.com/nasimuddinbd02/markdown-studio/releases/tag/v0.6.0)

### Added

- **Link check** for the whole folder (sidebar → Links): missing files and images, broken `#anchors` within and across files, and empty links.

### Security

- The Content Security Policy allows network requests only to `api.github.com`, for the update check.

## v0.5.0

### Security

- The interface has no direct file system, dialog or shell access; every file operation goes through checked native commands limited to the files and folders you open.
- Preview HTML is sanitized with GitHub's allow-list, and a strict Content Security Policy blocks scripts.
- Links open in the system browser, and only `http`, `https` and `mailto` links are allowed.

### Accessibility

- Keyboard access to every function and visible focus, audited automatically against WCAG 2.1 AA in light and dark themes.

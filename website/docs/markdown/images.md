# Images

## Syntax

```markdown
![Alt text describing the image](assets/diagram.png)
![Logo](https://example.com/logo.svg "Optional title")
```

The alt text is what screen readers read and what shows if the image can't load. The [Markdown lint](/guide/checking-documents) warns about images without it.

## Paste or drop images

The easiest way to add an image is to **paste** it (for example a screenshot) or **drag an image file** onto the editor:

1. Markdown Studio saves the image in an `assets` folder next to the document, creating the folder if needed.
2. It inserts a link with a relative path at the cursor. A pasted screenshot gets a timestamped name, for example `![image 20260925 140512](assets/image-20260925-140512.png)`; a dropped file keeps its name. Replace the alt text with a short description.

The document must be saved first, so Markdown Studio knows where to put the `assets` folder. Supported formats are PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, SVG, BMP and AVIF, up to 20 MB per image.

## Local images and paths

| Path | Example | Supported |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Relative to the document | `assets/photo.png`, `../images/logo.svg` | Yes (recommended), within the allowed locations below |
| Absolute file path | `C:/Users/me/Pictures/photo.png`, `/home/me/photo.png` | Within the allowed locations below |
| Web address | `https://example.com/image.png` | Yes, `https` only (loaded from the web when previewed; plain `http` is blocked) |
| Data URL | `data:image/png;base64,…` | Yes |

Relative paths are best: they keep working when you move the folder, share it, or push it to GitHub.

For privacy, local images load only from **the folder you opened as your workspace**, or, for a file opened on its own, **that file's folder and its subfolders** (see [Privacy](/privacy)). If an image lives elsewhere, for example `../images/` next to a single opened file, open the parent folder as your workspace.

## Preview

- Local images show in the preview once the document is saved.
- A missing image appears as a placeholder with its name and "(image not found)", and the [link check](/guide/checking-documents#link-check) lists it.
- Images larger than 20 MB aren't previewed.

## Export

- **HTML export** embeds the images in the file, so it works on its own.
- **PDF** and **Word** exports embed the images too.
- **Combine Folder** and **Export Folder** adjust image paths so they still work in the combined document.

## Autocompletion

Type `![](` to get a list of the images in your workspace.

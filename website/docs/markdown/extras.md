# Front matter, alerts & footnotes

## Front matter

YAML front matter is a block of metadata at the very top of a file, between two `---` lines. Static site generators such as Jekyll and Hugo, and apps such as Obsidian, use it:

```markdown
---
title: Release checklist
author: Docs team
tags: [release, process]
date: 2026-09-25
---

# Release checklist
```

- In the **preview**, the front matter is shown as a small table of keys and values, like on GitHub.
- It's **left out of exports** (HTML, PDF and Word).
- If it has a `title`, that becomes the title of the exported document.

## Alerts

Alerts are GitHub's highlighted callouts. Start a quote with one of five markers:

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate attention.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes.
```

The **preview** and **HTML export** show them as coloured callouts with an icon and a title. **PDF** and **Word** exports show them as callouts labelled Note, Tip, Important, Warning or Caution. On GitHub, the same Markdown shows GitHub's alert style.

## Footnotes

Footnotes put a reference number in the text and the note at the end of the document:

```markdown
Markdown Studio stores files locally.[^1]

[^1]: Nothing is uploaded unless you share the file yourself.
```

**Format → Insert Footnote** (**Ctrl+Alt+R**, **Cmd+Option+R** on macOS) inserts the next free number at the cursor, adds the definition at the end of the document, and moves the cursor there so you can type the note.

In the **preview**, **HTML export** and **Print / Save as PDF**, references become superscript links to a **Footnotes** section at the end, with links back.

::: warning Footnotes in PDF and Word exports
**Export as PDF** currently leaves footnotes out, and **Export as Word** leaves out the reference numbers and puts the notes' text at the end as paragraphs. To keep footnotes, use **Export as HTML** or **Print / Save as PDF**.

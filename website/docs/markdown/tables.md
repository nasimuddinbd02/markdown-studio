# Tables

## Syntax

A table has a header row, a delimiter row of dashes, and body rows. Cells are separated by `|`:

```markdown
| Name  | Qty | Note  |
| ----- | --- | ----- |
| Apple | 10  | fresh |
| Kiwi  | 2   |       |
```

The outer pipes are optional, and the columns don't have to line up; **Format Table** lines them up for you.

## Alignment

Colons in the delimiter row align a column:

```markdown
| Left | Centre | Right |
| :--- | :----: | ----: |
| a    |   b    |     c |
```

## Table tools

| Command | Shortcut | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Insert Table | | Inserts a two-column table to fill in |
| Format Table | Ctrl+Alt+T | Pads every column to the same width and normalizes the delimiter row. Wide characters (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, emoji) count as two columns, so tables stay aligned |
| Sort Table by Column (A to Z / Z to A) | | Sorts the body rows by the column the cursor is in, then formats the table |
| Copy Table as CSV | | Copies the table at the cursor as CSV for a spreadsheet |

All of them are in the **Format** menu and the command palette, and can be undone.

### How sorting works

- If every filled cell in the column is a number (for example `1,200`, `3.5%` or `$9`), rows are sorted numerically, so 90 comes before 1,200.
- Otherwise they're sorted as text, ignoring case, with numbers inside text in natural order (`item9` before `item10`).
- Rows with an empty cell in that column always go last, and rows with equal values keep their order.

## Tables from spreadsheets and CSV

- **Paste** cells copied from Excel or Google Sheets into the editor; they become a Markdown table.
- **File → Import CSV as Table…** converts a `.csv` or `.tsv` file into a table.

## Editing tips

- Use **Alt+drag** to select a rectangular block, for example one column, and edit it with multiple cursors.
- To put a `|` inside a cell, escape it: `\|`.
- Cells hold inline content only: text, emphasis, code, links and images, but not lists or paragraphs. Use `<br>` for a line break inside a cell.

## Preview

Tables render with borders and a header row, and wide tables scroll horizontally in the preview. They're exported as real tables to PDF, Word and HTML.

# Roadmap

This roadmap comes from the project's [requirements specification](https://github.com/nasimuddin-dev/markdown-studio/blob/main/docs/SRS.md) and [development log](https://github.com/nasimuddin-dev/markdown-studio/blob/main/docs/DEV_LOG.md). It shows direction, not commitments: there are no dates, and plans can change. Suggestions are welcome in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nasimuddin-dev/markdown-studio/issues).

## Completed

- **Core editor (MVP):** create, open, edit, preview and save Markdown; workspaces and file explorer; tabs; find and replace; themes; settings; keyboard shortcuts; native dialogs.
- **Reliability:** safe atomic saves, external-change detection, crash recovery, recent files and local file history.
- **Rich Markdown:** GitHub Flavored Markdown, Mermaid diagrams, LaTeX math, front matter, alerts and footnotes.
- **Productivity:** outline, command palette, Find in Files, formatting tools, tables, templates, table of contents, Markdown lint and link checking.
- **Conversion:** import from Word, PDF, HTML and CSV; export to PDF, Word and HTML, including whole folders.
- **Distribution:** separate installers for Windows, macOS and Linux on every release, and signed automatic updates on Windows.

See the [changelog](/changelog) for details per version.

## In progress

Nothing is actively under development right now. The next items are chosen from the Planned list.

## Planned

- **Math in PDF export.** Today formulas are rendered in HTML export, Print → Save as PDF and Word export (as Word equations).
- **Performance:** a smaller startup bundle and benchmarks with very large documents.
- **End-to-end tests of the native app** on Windows, macOS and Linux, and testing the macOS and Linux builds on real hardware.

## Considering

These depend on decisions or resources that aren't settled yet:

- **Code signing:** Windows Authenticode and Apple notarization, so the first launch doesn't show warnings. This needs signing certificates.
- **Automatic updates on macOS and Linux**, like on Windows.
- **ARM64 builds** for Windows and Linux.
- **Localization** of the interface into other languages.
- **A native macOS menu bar.**
- **Future enhancements from the specification:** an optional AI writing assistant (with clear consent before any text leaves your computer), Git integration, plugins, cloud sync, collaboration and publishing workflows.

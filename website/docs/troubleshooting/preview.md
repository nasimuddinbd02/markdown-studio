# Preview, Mermaid & math

## The preview says "Live preview is paused"

**Problem:** the preview shows *"Live preview is paused for large documents"* with a **Render Now** button.

**Possible cause:** the document is larger than 1 MB of text. Re-rendering on every keystroke would slow down typing.

**Solution:** click **Render Now** to render it, and **Refresh Preview** after editing. Splitting very large documents also helps.

## An image doesn't show

**Symptoms:** the preview shows a placeholder: *"(image not found)"* or *"(save the document to show local images)"*.

**Possible causes and solutions:**

- **The document hasn't been saved yet.** Relative image paths need a location. Save the document.
- **The path is wrong.** Paths are relative to the document, and letter case matters on macOS and Linux. The [link check](/guide/checking-documents#link-check) lists missing images.
- **The image is outside the allowed locations.** Local images load only from the open workspace folder or, for a single file, its folder and subfolders. Open the parent folder as your workspace. See [Images](/markdown/images).
- **The image uses `http://`.** Only `https://` web images are loaded.
- **The image is larger than 20 MB.**

## A Mermaid diagram shows "Diagram error"

**Problem:** instead of a diagram, the preview shows **Diagram error:** and a message from Mermaid.

**Possible cause:** a syntax error in the diagram code.

**Solution:** check the first line (diagram type), quote labels that contain special characters (`A["Save (Ctrl+S)"]`), and check the arrow syntax. The [Mermaid page](/markdown/mermaid#troubleshooting) has examples, and the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live) shows detailed errors.

## A diagram or formula appears as code

**Possible cause:** rendering is turned off, or the code block isn't marked correctly.

**Solution:**

- Check **Settings → Preview → Render Mermaid diagrams** and **Render LaTeX math**.
- The code block must start with exactly ` ```mermaid `.
- In **PDF** and **Word** exports, formulas are shown as LaTeX text (diagrams are drawn). Use **Export as HTML** or **Print / Save as PDF** for formulas.

## Text with dollar signs turns into math

**Problem:** "costs $5 or $10" shows part of the sentence as a formula.

**Solution:** escape the dollar signs: `\$5 or \$10`.

## A formula is shown in red

**Possible cause:** KaTeX couldn't parse the formula, so it shows the source in red instead of breaking the preview.

**Solution:** check the LaTeX syntax against [KaTeX's supported functions](https://katex.org/docs/supported). Text-mode commands and packages aren't available.

## A link in the preview doesn't open

**Possible cause:** for safety, the preview opens only `http`, `https` and `mailto` links (in your browser), `#heading` links, and links to Markdown files. Other link types are blocked, and a message says so.

## Report an issue

If a document renders differently from GitHub, [report it on GitHub](https://github.com/nasimuddinbd02/markdown-studio/issues/new) with a small Markdown sample.

# Privacy

Markdown Studio is a local-first app. This page describes what it actually does with your data.

## Your documents stay on your computer

- Markdown Studio reads and writes the files you open, where they are on your disk. It doesn't upload, sync or copy them anywhere.
- There's **no account**, **no sign-in**, and **no cloud service**.
- Import and export (Word, PDF, HTML, CSV) run entirely on your computer.

## No telemetry

Markdown Studio doesn't collect usage statistics, analytics or crash reports, and doesn't send any data about you or your documents.

## Network access

Markdown Studio works fully offline. It connects to the internet in only these cases:

| When | What happens | Can you turn it off? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| At startup, and when you choose **Help → Check for Updates…** | It asks GitHub (`api.github.com`) for the latest version number. Like any web request, this reveals your IP address to GitHub. No document data is sent. | Yes: **Settings → Startup → Check for updates when Markdown Studio starts** |
| When you choose **Update Now** (Windows) | It downloads the new installer from GitHub Releases. | Don't choose Update Now |
| When a document you preview contains an `https://` image | The image is loaded from its web server, as in a browser. | Use local images |
| When you click a web link in the preview | The link opens in your browser. | |

The app's Content Security Policy limits its own network requests to `api.github.com`.

## What's stored on your computer

Markdown Studio keeps these in your user profile (see [Configuration](/reference/configuration) for the exact folders):

- **Settings** and the list of **recent files and folders**.
- **File history:** the previous version of a file each time you save it (30 per file), so you can restore it.
- **Crash recovery:** snapshots of unsaved documents, so they can be recovered after a crash.
- **Logs:** operations and error types, **never document content**, with your home folder shown as `~`.

Delete those folders to remove everything; uninstalling leaves them in place so a reinstall keeps your settings.

## Limited file access

The part of the app that displays the interface has no direct access to your files. Every file operation goes through native code that only allows the files and folders you've opened yourself (and their contents), rejects path tricks such as `..`, and resolves shortcuts and links before checking.

## Safe documents

Documents can contain HTML, so the preview removes anything that could run code (scripts, event handlers, iframes, forms) and opens links only in your browser. Opening a Markdown file from someone else can't run code in Markdown Studio.

## This website

# How to create Mermaid diagrams in Markdown

*2026-09-25*

A diagram drawn in a graphics tool is a picture: to change one label, you open the tool again, edit, export and replace the image. [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org) takes a different approach. You describe the diagram in text inside your Markdown, and the viewer draws it. Changing a label means editing a word, and version control shows exactly what changed.

GitHub, GitLab and many editors, including [Markdown Studio](/markdown/mermaid), render Mermaid in Markdown files.

## The basic idea

Put the diagram in a code block whose language is `mermaid`:

````markdown
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Write] --> B[Review] --> C[Publish]
```
````

The first line names the diagram type. The rest describes it.

## Flowcharts

Flowcharts are the most common Mermaid diagram:

````markdown
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([Start]) --> Q{Tests pass?}
    Q -->|Yes| Deploy[Deploy to staging]
    Q -->|No| Fix[Fix the failures]
    Fix --> Q
    Deploy --> Done([Done])
```
````

- `TD` draws top-down; `LR` draws left to right.
- The shape comes from the brackets: `[box]`, `([rounded])`, `{decision}`, `((circle))`.
- `-->` is an arrow, `---` a line, and `-->|label|` a labelled arrow.

## Sequence diagrams

Sequence diagrams show messages between participants over time, which is ideal for APIs and protocols:

````markdown
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant S as Server
    C->>S: POST /login
    S-->>C: 200 OK + token
    C->>S: GET /profile (token)
    S-->>C: 200 OK
```
````

`->>` is a solid arrow (a request) and `-->>` a dashed one (a response).

## Gantt charts

````markdown
```mermaid
gantt
    title Documentation release
    dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD
    section Writing
    Draft guides      :a1, 2026-10-01, 7d
    Review            :after a1, 3d
    section Publishing
    Publish website   :2026-10-12, 1d
```
````

## Tips for readable diagrams

- **Keep them small.** If a diagram needs scrolling, split it into two.
- **Quote labels with special characters:** `A["Save (Ctrl+S)"]`.
- **Use `subgraph`** to group related nodes in a flowchart.
- **Check errors early.** A syntax error stops the whole diagram from drawing, so preview as you type. Markdown Studio shows Mermaid's error message in place of the diagram.

## Where Mermaid works

Mermaid in Markdown renders on GitHub, GitLab, in many documentation site generators, and in editors with Mermaid support. For documents you share as files, check that the output format keeps the diagram: in Markdown Studio, **Export as HTML** and **Print → Save as PDF** include drawn diagrams (see [Mermaid](/markdown/mermaid#export)).

The [Mermaid documentation](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/) covers every diagram type, including class, state, entity-relationship, mindmap and timeline diagrams.

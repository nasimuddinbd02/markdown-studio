### ⬇️ [Download Markdown Studio 0.8.0 for Windows (64-bit)](downloads/MarkdownStudio-0.8.0-windows-x64-setup.exe?raw=true)

Released 2026-09-25 for Windows 10 (1803+) and 11, x64. Nothing else needs to be installed: the app is self-contained.

| Installer | When to use it | Size | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Standard**: [MarkdownStudio-0.8.0-windows-x64-setup.exe](downloads/MarkdownStudio-0.8.0-windows-x64-setup.exe?raw=true) | Recommended. WebView2 is already part of Windows 11 and updated Windows 10; if it's missing, the installer adds it automatically (needs internet) | 6.9 MB | `695c0b2e815e3565f83a96f309ac29f39761e132bde577bc3c35cfa88fa6ebb4` |
| **Offline**: [MarkdownStudio-0.8.0-windows-x64-offline-setup.exe](https://github.com/nasimuddinbd02/markdown-studio/releases/download/v0.8.0/MarkdownStudio-0.8.0-windows-x64-offline-setup.exe) | Includes WebView2; no internet needed | 211.9 MB | `d556d1ce5aae473229c0b2183834badeb876506cb0b5a9f2298604257e6a4809` |

**Install in 3 steps:**

1. **Download** an installer above (all files are also on the [0.8.0 release page](https://github.com/nasimuddinbd02/markdown-studio/releases/tag/v0.8.0)).
2. **Run** it and choose **Anyone who uses this computer**, which needs administrator approval, or **Only for me**, which doesn't. The installer isn't code-signed yet, so if Windows SmartScreen says *"Windows protected your PC"*, choose **More info → Run anyway**.
3. **Start** Markdown Studio from the Start menu, or right-click any `.md` file and choose **Open with Markdown Studio**.

The app appears in **Settings → Apps → Installed apps** and in **Control Panel → Programs and Features**, where it can be uninstalled. Newer versions install over older ones and keep your settings. For requirements, checksum verification, silent install, uninstalling and troubleshooting, see the **[installation guide](docs/INSTALL.md)**.

## Features

- Create, open, edit, save and Save As Markdown files (`.md`, `.markdown`) with native dialogs
- Windows shell integration: "Open with Markdown Studio" in the right-click menu, listed under Open with and Default apps, Installed apps / Programs and Features entry, install for "Only me" or "Everyone"
- Opens files from the OS: double-click / "Open with" (file association), drag and drop onto the window, and single-instance hand-off
- Paste or drop images into a document: they are saved to an `assets/` folder next to it and linked automatically
- Workspace folders with a file explorer: new file/folder, rename (F2), delete to the Trash/Recycle Bin, Reveal in File Explorer, Copy (Relative) Path
- Tab context menu: Close Others, Close to the Right, Close Saved, Copy Path, Reveal
- Tabs with dirty indicators, and Save / Don't Save / Cancel prompts on close and on quit
- Link autocompletion (workspace files after `](`, images after `![](`, headings after `](#`) and Format Table (Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+T) that aligns GFM tables, CJK-aware
- Format menu and shortcuts: bold (Ctrl/Cmd+B), italic (I), link (K), inline code (E), strikethrough, headings (Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+1–3), lists, task lists, quotes, code blocks and tables
- CodeMirror 6 editor with Markdown syntax highlighting, code-block languages, undo/redo, multi-cursor, find & replace (case-sensitive, regex, whole word) and go to line
- Import Word (.docx), PDF and web pages (.html) as Markdown (headings, lists, tables, links, images saved to assets/), and paste rich text from browsers or Word as Markdown
- CSV/TSV tools: import a .csv or .tsv file as an aligned Markdown table, paste cells copied from Excel or Google Sheets as a table, and Copy Table as CSV for spreadsheets
- Convert Folder to Markdown (File menu): converts every Word, PDF, HTML and CSV/TSV file in the open folder to a .md file beside it in one step; files that already have a Markdown version are skipped
- Combine Folder into One Document (File menu): merges every Markdown file in the folder (README/index first, natural order) into `<Folder> (combined).md` with a table of contents; links between the files become in-document links and image paths are re-based. Export it as PDF or Word to share the folder as a single file
- Link check (sidebar → Links, or Edit → Check Links in Folder): finds broken links to files, missing images and `file.md#heading` anchors across every Markdown file in the folder. Click a problem to jump to it
- Automatic updates: at startup, the app checks GitHub for a newer version and offers **Update Now**. It downloads the update, verifies its signature, installs it over the current version and restarts. You can also use Help → Check for Updates, or turn the startup check off in Settings. Nothing else is sent
- Table of contents: Format → Insert / Update Table of Contents builds a linked, nested TOC that stays up to date on save (Settings → Files)
- Export to PDF (selectable text, clickable links, heading bookmarks, tables, task checkboxes, images) and to Word (.docx) with real Word headings, numbered/bulleted/task lists, tables, code, links and embedded images
- Export to standalone HTML (styled, images inlined, sanitized), Copy as HTML, and Print / Save as PDF (Ctrl/Cmd+P)
- Markdown lint in the editor: broken links, missing images, broken anchors, duplicate headings, skipped heading levels and missing alt text, with a Problems panel
- Focus Mode (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Enter), Full Screen (F11) and a searchable Keyboard Shortcuts reference (Help menu)
- Command palette (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P), document outline, and Find in Files across the workspace (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+F; match case, whole word, regex)
- Mermaid diagrams (lazy-loaded, strict security mode) and LaTeX math (`$…$`, `$$…$$`, rendered as MathML) in the preview and exports
- Live GitHub Flavored Markdown preview (tables, task lists, strikethrough, autolinks, fenced code with highlighting) with a configurable debounce
- Editor-only, split and preview-only views, resizable panels and synced scrolling
- Light, dark and system themes; configurable font, font size, line numbers, wrapping and tab size
- Optional auto save (after a delay, or on tab/window focus change) that never overwrites external changes
- Save options: trim trailing whitespace (keeps Markdown hard breaks and code blocks), final newline, default line ending for new files
- Large-document mode: live preview pauses above 1 MB of text, with render-on-demand
- Local file history: the previous version is kept on every save (30 per file, in app data); browse with a line diff and restore (undoable)
- Safe saves: atomic temp-file writes, conflict detection when a file changed on disk, and actionable errors (permission denied → Save As, disk full, and so on)
- Live folder watching: the explorer and open files update immediately when other programs change files on disk
- External change detection: clean tabs reload automatically; dirty tabs get Reload / Compare / Keep Mine
- Crash recovery for unsaved documents, and session restore for the last folder and open files
- UTF-8 (with or without BOM), with LF/CRLF line endings preserved per file
- Keyboard-first: every core action has a shortcut and an accessible menu, with visible focus states

## Security model

- The frontend has **no direct filesystem, dialog or shell permissions** ([capabilities/default.json](src-tauri/capabilities/default.json)). Every native operation goes through validated Rust commands ([src-tauri/src/commands.rs](src-tauri/src/commands.rs)).
- A path is accessible only after the user selects it in a native dialog, or re-opens it from the backend-owned recent list. Relative paths and `..` traversal are rejected, and symlinks are resolved before the scope check ([scope.rs](src-tauri/src/scope.rs)).
- The preview parses raw HTML and then sanitizes it with GitHub's allow-list. Scripts, event handlers, iframes, forms, styles and `javascript:` URLs are removed. A strict CSP forbids inline scripts.
- Links open in the system browser, and only `http`, `https` and `mailto` links are allowed.
- Logs record the operation and error category, never document content; the home directory is redacted.

## Development

Prerequisites: **Node.js 20+**, **Rust (stable)** and the [Tauri system dependencies](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your OS: Microsoft C++ Build Tools and WebView2 on Windows, Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS, and `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev` and friends on Linux.

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run tauri:dev
```

That runs the desktop app with hot reload. Other scripts:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | UI only, in a browser, using an in-memory demo workspace (no Rust needed) |
| `npm test` | Frontend unit/component tests (Vitest + Testing Library) |
| `npm run test:e2e` | End-to-end tests (Playwright) against the browser demo; uses the installed Microsoft Edge on Windows |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript type check |
| `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` | Rust tests (scope, safe save, encoding, settings) |
| `npm run tauri:build` | Builds installers for the current OS |

### Browser demo mode

When it runs outside Tauri, the app uses [`MemoryBackend`](src/services/memoryBackend.ts). This is an in-memory filesystem that enforces the same scope and conflict rules, is seeded with sample documents, and persists to `localStorage`. It makes UI work and tests possible without the native shell.

## Releasing a new version

```bash
npm run version:set 0.4.0
```

```bash
npm run release:installer -- --offline
```

```bash
npm run release:github
```

1. `version:set` updates the version in `package.json`, `tauri.conf.json` and `Cargo.toml`.
2. `release:installer -- --offline` builds two Windows installers:
   - the **standard** installer (~4 MB) replaces the one in [`downloads/`](downloads/), where only the latest version is kept;
   - the **offline** installer (~210 MB, with the WebView2 runtime) goes to `release-assets/`. It's too large for git, so it's ignored.

   It also writes `SHA256SUMS.txt` and refreshes the download links in this README and in [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).
3. Commit and push, then run `release:github`. It creates or updates the GitHub Release `v<version>` with both installers, the checksums and `latest.json`, using the GitHub CLI (`gh auth login` once). Installed apps pick up the new version automatically on their next start.

**Update signing key.** Updates are signed with a minisign key. `release:installer` reads the private key from `~/.tauri/markdown-studio.key`, or from the `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable. The matching public key is in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. **Never commit the private key, and keep a backup somewhere safe.** Installed apps only accept updates signed with this exact key; if it's lost, users would have to reinstall manually once to switch to a new key.

## Packaging and releases

`npm run tauri:build` produces:

- **Windows**: `.msi` and NSIS `.exe` installers
- **macOS**: `.app` and `.dmg`
- **Linux**: `.AppImage`, `.deb` and `.rpm`

Pushing a tag like `v0.1.0` runs [.github/workflows/release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml), which builds every platform (including both macOS architectures) and creates a draft GitHub Release. Code signing and notarization secrets are documented inline in the workflow.

Settings, recovery data and logs live in the platform's application-data folders, under the identifier `com.markdownstudio.app`.
